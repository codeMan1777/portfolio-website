        About
    </h1>

    <p>
        Greetings, <br>
        I'm a dedicated computer science student from Virginia in my third year.
    </p>

    <p>
        Beyond being a Junior at Virginia Commonwealth University studying Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering, I am passionate about creating impactful software solutions that enhance productivity and user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        My journey into technology began with a curiosity for how things work, and it has evolved into a deep commitment to mastering full-stack development. I have hands-on experience with Python, Flask, React, and database design, and I enjoy tackling challenging problems through innovative solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Iâ€™ve worked on projects ranging from microservices for e-commerce platforms to interactive tools that help students prepare for exams. Each project has strengthened my problem-solving skills and attention to detail.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy hiking, staying updated on tech trends, and exploring creative ways to improve my skills. I aim to grow into a full-stack developer capable of delivering efficient and scalable applications.
    </p>
